Data Structures in C: Stacks and Queues
---------------------------------------
A stack is an organized group of data that follows the rule of First In Last Out(FILO/LILO)
Conversely, queues are arranged as first in first out, which maintains the order.
Stacks employ: push, pop, isEmpty, isFull and top functions to manipulate data stored.
Queues employ: enqueue, dequeue, rear, front, isFull/isEmpty and both are enbled in C using arrays and linked lists
